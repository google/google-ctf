name: Lost In Transliteration
# Long form description.
description: |+
  We found a service that converts Greek characters to Latin. It seems simple:
  ΕΛΛΑΣ becomes ELLAS.

  However, our logs show some very strange outputs. The service is flawed, but we
  think it's by design. There's a secret hidden in the way it handles the characters.
  Your job is to find what's "lost" in the transliteration.
  The flag is in there somewhere. Good luck.
