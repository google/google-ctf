description: >
  The whispers of forgotten ages had led you here, to a scar in the earth
  veiled by shimmering heat and illusion. Before you lay the threshold to
  the fabled Hall of Records. As your shadow fell upon the entrance, a
  silent thunder echoed not in the air but the very marrow of your bones.
  A voice that knew your name without you ever speaking it. Your gaze was
  compelled upward to meet the monolithic stare of the Giza Sphinx, the
  ageless stone titan. It did not offer a choice, it imposed a trial.
  Your passage was barred, your fate held in the balance of a single,
  timeless riddle. Three scrolls of papyrus, brittle as a desert bone,
  materialized before you. They hinted at the question, yet a deeper,
  chilling certainty gripped you: the true key was not in these cryptic
  texts, but in a different tome, yet unseen.


  The voice of the Sphinx did not merely echo in your mind, it engrained
  itself onto your consciousness. The words were structures of immense
  power, each one a key to a concept so vast it threatened to overwhelm
  you. You stood between the time-eater and the Hall of Records, with
  three scrolls whispering secrets you couldn't parse, armed only with
  the desperate knowledge that the key to your survival was Biham's book.
  One that did not exist in this place. The riddle was not just in the
  scrolls. The riddle was your predicament.
