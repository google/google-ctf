# name: "Home Computer"

description: "Blunderbussing your way through the decision making process, you figure that one is as good as the other and that further research into the importance of Work Life balance is of little interest to you. You're the decider after all. You confidently use the credentials to access the \"Home Computer.\"\n\nSomething called \"desktop\" presents itself, displaying a fascinating round and bumpy creature (much like yourself) labeled  \"cauliflower 4 work - GAN post.\"  Your 40 hearts skip a beat.  It looks somewhat like your neighbors on XiXaX3.   ..Ah XiXaX3... You'd spend summers there at the beach, an awkward kid from ObarPool on a family vacation, yearning, but without nerve, to talk to those cool sophisticated locals.\n\nSo are these \"Cauliflowers\" earthlings? Not at all the unrelatable bipeds you imagined them to be.  Will they be at the party?  Hopefully SarahH has left some other work data on her home computer for you to learn more."
