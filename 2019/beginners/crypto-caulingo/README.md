description: "Well you've done it, you're now an admin of the Cookie World Order. The clandestine organisation that seeks to control the world through a series of artfully placed tasty treats, bringing folks back in to their idea of what a utopian society would look like. Strangely enough, the webcam data is being fed to understand the properties of the entities you had originally seen. They seem to be speaking back into the camera (an unadvertised microphone) but it's hard to understand what they want. You must- if nothing else ever was important in your life, you must make contact with these beautiful creatures! Also, what exactly is a \"cauliflower\"?"
