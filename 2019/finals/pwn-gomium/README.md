# name: "Gomium Browser"

description: The Gomium Browser is the latest, safest browser written entirely in the memory-safe language Go. Can you break it? Prepare an exploit, put it on your USB stick and come on stage demonstrate it live pwn2own-style! We will run `gomium file:///media/usb/exploit.htm` and you should pop `xcalc`. The computer will be a Debian 10 buster (https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/debian-10.1.0-amd64-netinst.iso) with Xfce and Go 1.13.3 installed (https://dl.google.com/go/go1.13.3.linux-amd64.tar.gz).
