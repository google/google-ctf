# name: Counting
# description: This strange program was found, which apparently specialises in counting. In order to find the flag, you need to output find what the output of ./counter 9009131337 is.  Update: Seems we have a minor bug in Counting - 32-bit truncation on getting the argument from command line. To get the flag you need to calculate the result of executing code for the full 64-bit 9009131337 value as the description states. A result for a truncated 32-bit value won't give you the correct result. We apologize for the inconvenience.





# flag: CTF{000001bae15b6382}"
