# Least Common Genominator?

## Flavor Text
Someone used this program to send me an encrypted message but I can't read it! It uses something called an LCG, do you know what it is? I dumped the first six consecutive values generated from it but what do I do with it?!

## Solution
see solution/README.md

## Repository Structure
- Attachments: What is sent to the players
- Src: Generate challenge, modify values used in config, or you can move the solver script into the attachments repo and run it to get the flag.
