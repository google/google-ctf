  I found a service that can tell me whether the flag is correct or not, but it is hard to guess... 
  Can you help me out here?

  Note: please solve this challenge locally first, everything needed to run it should be included
  in the attachment.

  Due to technical limitations of kCTF the challenge has to be solved using a single TCP connection. 
  A HTTP proxy was added to make accessing the challenge more convenient.
  See the powproxy folder in the attached archive for the source code and the binary.
