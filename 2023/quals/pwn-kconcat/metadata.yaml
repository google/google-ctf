# Long form description.
description: |+
  As we are running our mitigated kernel (https://github.com/thejh/linux/blob/b97cbfe06757d908412e6afa217b1fe77dc48282/MITIGATION_README),
  we could safely implement a super fast text concatenation functionality directly in the kernel.

  Get root code exec and run `cat /flag`. (Note: the flag file is 3780 bytes long.)
# The flag
