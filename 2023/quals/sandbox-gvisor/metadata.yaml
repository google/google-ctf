  gVisor is a container sandbox with a kernel written in the memory safe language Go.

  However, using unsafe pointers erroneously could still make it unsafe.

  The gVisor `runsc` in this challenge is patched on the commit version `192bfb03fb2f8f869d834885716a1b904f5c930d`.
  Read `Makefile` to learn how the `challenge` is built.

  The challenge is executed as `runsc --rootless --network=none --platform=systrap do --root=/tmp /exploit`,
  where `/lib` and `/lib64` is mounted at `/tmp/lib` and `/tmp/lib64`, and the binary is located at `/tmp/exploit`.
