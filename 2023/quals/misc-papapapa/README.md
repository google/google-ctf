# JPEG steg challenge

`white.jpg` is the file to be given to the players. `flag.jpg` is the solution,
obtained by some simple hex editing (`get_flag.py` will create `flag.jpg` given
`white.jpg`) to make some padding visible. `solution.md` contains an
explanation of how the challenge works.

`white.jpg` was generated by creating a 528x512 image in GIMP, then using
`convert` as follow:

`convert gimp.png -sampling-factor 3x1,3x1,3x1 -type truecolor white.jpg`

and finally reversing the edit done by `get_flag.py`.
