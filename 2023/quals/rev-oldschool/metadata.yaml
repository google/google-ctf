# Long form description.
description: |+
  This challenge takes you back to the (good) old days of crackmes.de.
  Your goal for this challenge is to write a "keygen", a program that
  generates valid passwords for arbitrary given usernames.
  You are also given `flag_maker.py` that contains a list of usernames
  that you have to find their corresponding passwords.
  Once you find all passwords, run the script and you will get the flag.

# The flag
flag: CTF{991d90ed198acc794d6dacd7e304f761c142acab}
