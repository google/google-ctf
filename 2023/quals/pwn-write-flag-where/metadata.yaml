# Human readable task name
name: write-flag-where

# Long form description.
description: |+
  This challenge is not a classical pwn
  In order to solve it will take skills of your own
  An excellent primitive you get for free
  Choose an address and I will write what I see
  But the author is cursed or perhaps it's just out of spite
  For the flag that you seek is the thing you will write
  ASLR isn't the challenge so I'll tell you what
  I'll give you my mappings so that you'll have a shot.
