Try:

```
sudo apt install libjxl-tools
djxl flag.jxl flag.png
xdg-open flag.png
```

Edit the top of the original image (ASCII-encoded flag bits) so that
the image verifies the flag as correct... however weird it sounds.

I would recommend an editor for this task, but as far as I know, nothing really
supports JXL enough... so hexeditor, I guess?
