  Take a break from the other challenges and play a relxing game of Minesweeper
  I have even solved most of the board for you and marked many of the mines.
  I am completely sure they are correct so you just need to find the remaining ones.

  Instructions:
  The game client requires pygame. Navigate the board with the arrow keys.
  Click an unexplored cell to toggle a flag marking a cell as containing a mine.
  Already placed flags can not be removed. Every cell with a number should have
  that many flags adjacent to it. Press "m" to validate the board.
  The flag will appear in the console.

# The flag
flag: CTF{d8675fca837faa20bc0f3a7ad10e9d2682fa0c35c40872938f1d45e5ed97ab27}
