# Storygen challenge

In this challenge you have access to a story generator (a very dumb one, to be
honest). For some reason it works by creating a shell script first (D'oh!).

It would have an obvious shell injection, but it's sanitized by removing
apostrophes so you cannot break out. Pwn it anyway.

Spoilers in the challenge directory.
